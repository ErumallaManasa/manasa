        1. Perfect Symmetry</32>
        <p>
The Taj Mahal emits a sense of peace and harmony which is mainly caused by the structure's near-perfect symmetry,
 the main dome and surrounding minarets, and the division of the gardens by four canals that meet at a raised central lotus pond.
The perfect geometry of the complex is what leaves a visitor in awe and is so perfect that one cannot find a single element out of place adding to the structure's grandeur. 
The symmetry of the Taj Mahal makes a statement of absoluteness which is a mark of architectural superiority and reflects universal harmony.

    <h3>
        2. Built with an Optical Illusion </h3>
        <p>To achieve the desired other-worldly experience, the Taj Mahal's minarets are placed in a specific way to create an optical illusion. Because the architects and craftsmen were masters of proportions, 
            they were able to build the monument in such a way that as soon as you enter the gate, the monument appears close and large. But as you approach it, it shrinks in size.

            This particular illusion was created to avoid any visual interruptions 
            and to add a touch of mystery to the place and was achieved through the minarets that
             appear to be perfectly upright but actually lean outward.
             In addition to creating the illusion of greater size, the lean of the minarets
              protects the main crypt in case of natural
              disasters like earthquakes. This way, they will always fall away from the central dome.</p>

              <h3>3. Use of Red Stone and White Marble</h3>
                <p>The hierarchal use of stones and colors in the building of the Taj Mahal adds many layers to its meaning. Before the Taj was built, 
                    red sandstone was used in most Mughal architecture, 
                    but Shah Jahan was greatly influenced by Hindu color coding for different castes.
             By taking the liberty of using white stone reserved for Brahmins (priestly caste) and Red Stone reserved for Kshatriyas (warrior caste) the
              Mughals identified with India's two leading classes and announced themselves as their rulers.

                The white marble also serves as a canvas for the changing light of the day and is said to reflect 
                the various moods of Shah Jahan during his time with Mumtaz Mahal.</p>

                <h3>4. The Exquisite Walls of the Taj Mahal</h3>
                <p>In order to add a holy aura to the place, the walls of the monument are covered with beautiful calligraphy and pietra dura. Pietra dura is a method of inlaying marble with precious stones like amber, 
                    coral, jade, and lapis lazuli.Since Islam condemns anthropomorphic art, the walls are carefully decorated with abstract art and vegetative motifs. Multiple techniques are used for the adornment of these walls including; mosaic art, murals, and incised painting.
                    The monument's walls are also decorated with fine calligraphic inscriptions done with carefully selected passages that evoke the themes of judgment and rewards for believers.</p>
