    <marquee><h2>TAJMAHAL HISTORY</h2></marquee>
    <p>Built between 1631 and 1654, the construction of the Taj Mahal was 
        ordered bythe ruling emperor Shah Jahan as a mausoleum for his favourite wife, 
        Empress Mumtaz Mahal.The Empress had died in 1631 whilst giving
         birth to the couple’s fourteenth child,Gauhara Begum and her jade and jasper adorned 
        coffin was placed in the centre of the Taj Mahal, 
         although her body and that of her husband (buried there later)
          are actually contained several floors below.
          The white marble structure of the Taj Mahal,
           with its central dome flanked by arches and smaller
           domes as well as minarets is famed for its incredible symmetry and opulent design.
           Inside, the Taj Mahal is lavishly decorated with plant life imagery and Koranic calligraphy,
           each aspect of which is entirely individual. 
           In fact, it is believed that approximately 20,000 workers toiled to create the Taj Mahal.
          Nearby are several other beautiful buildings,
           including the Taj Mahal’s mosque and the Jilaukhana gated complex,
            all of which add to the overall symmetry of the site.
          Some of the Taj Mahal’s original decoration has been looted over the 
          centuries and the white colour structure is suffering from the effects of pollution</p>
